      <p>I was born in Dunedin, New Zealand where I lived with my parents and
      two older brothers. My family moved to Wānaka in Central Otago in 1999,
      where we lived for the next ten years. I attended Wānaka Primary School,
      and then Mt Aspiring College for intermediate. My brothers moved back to
      Dunedin to attend University, so not too long after they moved, we
      followed them back. I attended Bayfield High School from 2009 - 2013 where
      I was heavily involved in sports throughout high school - I played
      netball, basketball, and volleyball. <br /><br />After high school, I
      moved to a very small, rural town called Owings, Maryland, in the US. I
      spent 15 months there where I worked as an Au Pair for an awesome family
      of five. I took care of three children, aged three, eight, and ten. <br
      /><br />When I returned home to NZ in 2015, I got a job as a casual lab
      assistant working in an animal genetics lab. I spend one year working
      there learning a lot about genetics, and performing hands-on lab
      procedures such as sample prep, quality checking, and DNA extractions.
      </p><p></p><p>After saving up enough money in that role, I headed off to
      enjoy the European summer for four months. I visited 18 countries, made
      new friends, visited family, and made so many unforgettable memories.
      Switzerland easily became my most favourite in the
      world!</p><p></p><p>After my travels, I came home to Dunedin and secured a
      permanent role as a Laboratory Technician at my old job. I worked here for
      the next seven years where I was constantly upskilling, </p>
