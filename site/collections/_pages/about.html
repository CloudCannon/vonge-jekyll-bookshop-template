      <p>I was born in Dunedin, New Zealand where I lived with my parents and
      two older brothers. My family moved to Wānaka in Central Otago in 1999,
      where we lived for the next ten years. I attended Wānaka Primary School,
      and then Mt Aspiring College for intermediate. My brothers moved back to
      Dunedin to attend University, so not too long after they moved, we
      followed them back. I attended Bayfield High School from 2009 - 2013 where
      I was heavily involved in sports throughout high school - I played
      netball, basketball, and volleyball. <br /><br />After high school, I
      moved to a very small, rural town called Owings, Maryland, in the US. I
      spent 15 months there where I worked as an Au Pair for an awesome family
      of five. I took care of three children, aged three, eight, and ten. <br
      /><br />When I returned home to NZ in 2015, I got a job as a casual lab
      assistant working in an animal genetics lab. I spend one year working
      there learning a lot about genetics, and performing hands-on lab
      procedures such as sample prep, quality checking, and DNA extractions.
      </p><p></p><p>After saving up enough money in that role, I headed off to
      enjoy the European summer for four months. I visited 18 countries, made
      new friends, visited family, and made so many unforgettable memories.
      Switzerland easily became my most favourite in the
      world!</p><p></p><p>After my travels, I came home to Dunedin and secured a
      permanent role as a Laboratory Technician at my old job. I worked here for
      the next seven years where I was constantly upskilling, taking on more
      responsibility, and always learning. I transitioned from my full time lab
      role, to being full time in the office. I was the main point of contact
      for all of our customers, so gained four years of customer service
      experience in this role. I also took care of ensuring all animal
      information was checked and loaded into our various databases.  I was then
      taught how to do the parentage and breed analysis for a range of species
      that came into the lab.</p><p>After seven years in my lab job, I decided
      to study 10 years after leaving high school. I spent one year of online
      leaning,  where I completed my Level 5 diploma in Web Development and
      Design. Throughout that year I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript. We build our own basic front-end focused websites, and went on
      to backend development. This included API's, schemas, and
      authentication.</p><p>During the first day of my third term break, I was
      in Ireland visiting family. As I was boarding a plane, I got an email
      saying my education provider had gone into liquidation, with only one term
      of the school year left to go. Luckily, I was able to find another
      provider, where I completed the remaider of my diploma. </p><p>During my
      studies, I worked at the Office Manager for CloudCannon LTD. CloudCannon
      is a Dunedin startup focused on simplifying the complexities of website
      management. They do this by combining a powerful, user-friendly Content
      Management System (CMS) with seamless static site generator integration. I
      was so lucky to be able to work and study in the most beautiful office,
      with extremely talented developers who always gave me expert advice and
      help when I needed it on the way. </p><p>In December 2023 I was hired as a
      Web Development Intern for CloudCannon, working in the Enterprise Success
      Team. For three months I was exposed to exciting and challenging tasks
      like learning new languages, SSGs, and taking on client work. I
      Implemented accessibility features to ensure inclusivity for all users on
      our existing templates, and I Optimised websites for search engines by
      implementing SEO best practices to improve visibility and organic traffic.
      The coolest project I worked on was for our biggest client - Netflix. I
      helped migrate Netflix's internal documentation websites from Google Sites
      to CloudCannon. It was such rewarding work, backed by the best
      people.</p><p>After my internship, I was hired by CloudCannon as a
      full-time Junior Software/engineer. </p>
