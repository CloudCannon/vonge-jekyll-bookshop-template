    description_html: >-
      <p>I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> hailing from the beautiful
      city of Dunedin, New Zealand. I have recently begun my journey in the tech
      world, so I'm always keen to learn more and develop awesome stuff on the
      web. I thrive on the buzz of collaborating with a vibrant team, bringing
      ideas to life, and tackling challenges head-on. Let's build cool things
      together and make a difference.</p>
