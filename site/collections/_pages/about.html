      <p>I was born in Dunedin, New Zealand where I lived with my parents and
      two older brothers. My family moved to Wānaka in Central Otago in 1999,
      where we lived for the next ten years. I attended Wānaka Primary School,
      and then Mt Aspiring College for intermediate. My brothers moved back to
      Dunedin to attend University, so not too long after they moved, we
      followed them back. I attended Bayfield High School from 2009 - 2013. I
      was heavily involved in sports throughout high school - I played netball,
      basketball, and volleyball. </p>
